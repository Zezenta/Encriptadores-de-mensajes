# Message Encrypters
Simple message encrypters for desktop, web browsers, and mobile
# Info
This is a series of simple programs that mix up the characters of a text with a specific format to make them apparently unreadable, making the people with the same software, the only ones able to read encrypted messages.
# Important
These programs do not use any form of modern encryptiong algorithms, therefore should not be used for any serious security purposes.
